Teaching English with a tourist visa is forbidden.Foreigners need a work visa + work permit.All these illegal foreigners have to go back to their countries: there are flights, borders of their countries are not closed for their citizens! and if they need money to buy a ticket they can ask help to their ambassy or family.
To the previous two commenters. This is a beautiful story about people who have enough, voluntarily sharing with grateful people who don't have enough. If your primary focus is on the relative wealth of the countries they are from, you have lost your humanity.
Vietnam should open after closing for 18 months otherwise it will become a ghost town and local will become zombie..life must go on!!!!!
Working on a tourist visa is illegal. Can these people can get a free flight home via deportation?
The comments here seem to deviate from the main theme of the article. Anyway, Covid situation in Vietnam now is quite unfortunate and the Government has their own way to deal with that and there's not much we can do about. What the article is trying to say is that Vietnamese people are friendly and helpful so don't hesitate to reach out if you need help.
It is possible to get out of Vietnam, I did it last July and returned in January of this year
Regardless of the reason(s) people are in dire needs it s WONDERFUL to see so many Vietnamese willing to share, help, spread joy and bring recomfort to the needy. One more reason to visit Viet Nam and give back a little. YOU the open heart YOU make Vietnam proud, YOU show the entire world YOUR true spirit and courage, Bless.
We are more worry than you with the convid wave in your country.open to vaccinated tourist we would not increase the wave but help the local ecomomic..
Think simple for easy life guys!
Good information for all people
How tragic. A lovely article about people helping people in difficult times... And comments are awash with middle class egos critical of the lower classes. 
Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive. Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.
Thank God for the Samaritans. Individuals must show responsibility when in foreigner countries. I love Vietnam and I love Vietnamese people.
People are working online these days and do this from all over the world.How do governments have control over people working from homes, a coworking space or coffee bar?The world is changing rapidly and Covid-19 stimulates that even more.Covid-19
